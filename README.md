# Dauntless Inventory tracker
After playing for a while, I discovered I got really annoyed at having to walk to the different vendors to have any clue whether I had enough of a certain orb or arcstone to upgrade my gear.  
The in-game tracker works to an extent for single piece of gear upgrades, but doesn't allow me to see how many pieces of upgrade materials I need in total.  
I started this project to fill that need.

## Plan
### Orbs and Arcstones
The first functionality I'd like to build is keeping track of Orbs and Arcstones. This'll just function as a quick lookup page.  
After this I plan to add total Orb and Arcstone requirements per type of gear (e.g. Swords, Armor sets, etc).  
The next step is to implement the different requirements per level.  
Moving on from that, the next step would be to add a calculator that will give you the total amount of Patrols needed to finish gathering all the Orbs/Arcstones.

### Saving gear progression
To make all of the above anywhere near useful, it's important for users to be able to save their current upgrade levels.

### Behemoth Breakparts
After all of the above, I'd like to expand the crafting requirements with the breakparts necessary for the different upgrade steps (craft, +6, +10, +15?)


### Patrol optimization
A distant possibility - I'd like to figure out how to optimize patrol hunting for the given user's inventory and getting to the +6 and +10 breakpoints for all pieces of gear
